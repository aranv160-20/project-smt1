            Star Lord, is a ravager searching a valuable orb on the surface of the dead planet Morag. When Peter finds the orb, 
            he is hunted down by the Kree warship The Dark Aster of the powerful Ronan the Accuser but he flees. Peter also 
            double crosses his partner Yondu Udonta 
		    that puts a reward on him.

			Peter Quill arrives on the Xandar city Nova Empire and is chased by Ronan's warrior Gamora and by the bounty hunters Rocket 
            and The Groot. They are arrested by the police officer Corpsman Dey and his men and sent to the prison The Kyln, where 
            they befriend the strong Drax. Soon they learn that Gamora wants to betray Ronan and sell the orb to a dealer for a huge

			They plot a plan to escape from The Kyln to sell the orb and split the money. But soon they also learn that the orb keeps the 
            infinity stone that gives immensurable destructive power to the owner. They self-proclaim Guardians of the Galaxy and decide 
            to deliver the orb to the leader Nova Prime to keep it safe from Ronan.
